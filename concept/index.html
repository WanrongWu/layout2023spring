    <h1>Game Objective</h1>
    <p>My game is a single-player fishing game, in which the player is intended to catch as many fish as possible in a certain amount of time, and unlock all the fish in the fishing guide. </p>
    
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>In this game, the player needs to judge whether to hook according to the movement of the buoy. Different Fish has diffferent scores, and there are some special items that deducts scores. The timer is set to 5 minutes. The player can view the caught fish (and other items) in the fishing bucket, or inventory. Potentially the player can update the rod and bait using the scores they get from selling fish in a store.  </p>
    <p>The game ends after a set amount of time has elapsed, and the player's score is tallied up. The player can then compare their score to those of other players, either locally or online, to see who caught the most fish and earned the highest score.</p>
